# Setting up a test server

Some of the tests require contact to a real Solr server.  Its name
must be set as environment variable SOLR_TEST_SERVER.

The server should support Fields 'id', 'subject', 'content_type',
and 'content'.  In my 3.6 server, the 'content' fields was missing
from the default server configuration.  I had to add

     <field name="content" type="string" indexed="true" stored="true" />

to the schema.xml file, and then restart jetty9
